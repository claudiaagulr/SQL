#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT Count(ORDERID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(OrderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderId)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product= 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cus
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cus.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Distinct product, Min(Price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
Order by price asc
Limit 1;

SELECT Sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id 
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2 
AND length(orderid) = 6
